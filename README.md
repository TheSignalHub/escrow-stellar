# The Signal — Stellar Escrow Demo

Milestone-based escrow with atomic 3-way payment splits on Soroban. Built for the [Stellar Community Fund (SCF) Integration Track](https://communityfund.stellar.org/).

## What This Is

A fully functional implementation of The Signal's deal escrow system on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform. It demonstrates how a real-world B2B marketplace handles milestone-based payments with three-party atomic splits — the exact logic running in production at [thesignal.directory](https://thesignal.directory).

## SCF #42 Tranche 2 Testnet Notes

This repository is configured for the Tranche 2 testnet review:

- **Deliverable 4**: DealEscrow is deployed to Soroban Testnet and connected to the marketplace frontend.
- **Deliverable 5**: DealEscrow event topics and indexer mapping are published in [`docs/EVENT_SCHEMA.md`](docs/EVENT_SCHEMA.md), with an isolated testnet indexer and purpose-built read-only reviewer dashboard in [`indexer`](indexer).
- **Deliverable 6**: The frontend exposes a Broker-style multi-asset funding step. On testnet, the adapter routes XLM into the configured demo test USDC settlement asset through a seeded Soroswap router path because public indexed testnet liquidity may be unavailable after resets.
- **Final-tranche cross-chain adapter**: NEAR Intents is integrated as a feature-flagged server adapter for cross-chain Stellar wallet top-up, not direct escrow funding. The first pending milestone can request a NEAR Intents quote from the Deals tab using the remaining pending deal balance, while Wallet Prep remains available for testnet funding and Stellar settlement-asset preparation. After the Stellar wallet is topped up, the user must confirm **Fund Deal**, which calls `fund_deal` and keeps escrow funding gated on Soroban `funded` events. Quotes use live 1Click token discovery for user-selected source chain/source asset/source amount, constrain the destination to the deal's approved Stellar settlement asset, and verify 1Click quote signatures server-side. Live source-chain execution remains disabled until no-testnet tiny-amount evidence is complete.

Coolify deployment env and operations are documented in
[`docs/COOLIFY_DEMO_DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/COOLIFY_DEMO_DEPLOYMENT.md). Keep live
server secrets in Coolify or a secrets manager, not in git.

`/market_dashboard` is intentionally public and read-only for review. `/admin`
and manual indexer controls are protected by `ADMIN_USERNAME` /
`ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

Backend readiness can be checked before frontend QA from `indexer/`:

```bash
BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://stellar.thesignal.directory npm run smoke:backend
```

The smoke command checks health, NEAR readiness, indexer/dashboard state,
dispute-event evidence, shadow bindings, and optional protected NEAR dry-quote
or indexer actions when admin credentials are supplied.

```

The test USDC token is a demo-only SEP-41 testnet token, not Circle-issued
USDC. The Soroswap route is used to prove the non-USDC source asset flow on
testnet: XLM in, demo test USDC settlement asset out, then escrow funding.

The indexer database is not the source of truth for funds or deal state. The
Soroban contract remains the source of truth; the isolated MongoDB indexer
database is a read model for marketplace-style status sync and reviewer
visibility.

Network endpoints are environment-driven. The app defaults to testnet for SCF
review, but `VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK`, `VITE_STELLAR_RPC_URL`,
`VITE_STELLAR_HORIZON_URL`, and `VITE_STELLAR_EXPLORER_URL` can be set for a
mainnet/staging profile. Friendbot is testnet-only and hidden outside testnet.
Settlement asset policy, precision, minimum amount, and trustline notes are in
[`docs/SETTLEMENT_ASSET_POLICY.md`](docs/SETTLEMENT_ASSET_POLICY.md).

## Marketplace Integration Positioning

This repo deliberately keeps the Stellar settlement rail isolated from The
Signal's production marketplace database. That is a product and safety choice:
the live marketplace remains responsible for discovery, KYB, matching, client
qualification, and commercial workflow, while this repo proves the reusable
escrow rail.

For final-tranche validation, the intended path is a marketplace-compatible
binding layer rather than direct writes into production marketplace
collections. A marketplace can map its own external deal IDs, milestone IDs,
provider wallets, connector wallets, and client wallets to Soroban `deal_id`
values through an adapter/API model. The Signal is the reference marketplace,
but the rail is designed to be reusable by other service marketplaces.

NEAR Intents is now treated as a required final-tranche integration workstream,
not an optional deferral. The current repo includes a feature-flagged adapter
around the official `@defuse-protocol/one-click-sdk-typescript` SDK, protected
quote/status/deposit/reconcile APIs, binding metadata persistence, and a
deal-level cross-chain top-up entry for choosing source chain/asset,
settlement asset, quote, payment instructions, and payment status against a
selected pending milestone. The NEAR route prepares the connected Stellar
wallet; the escrow is funded only when the user confirms **Fund Deal** and the
frontend calls `fund_deal`. Wallet Prep remains a support surface for
testnet funding and Stellar settlement-asset preparation, not the primary
cross-chain top-up entry.
Refund routing is managed through the source wallet in the production flow,
with a server fallback reserved for internal quote QA. Soroban `funded` events
remain the source of truth for escrow funding, even when NEAR Intents reports
that a cross-chain payment is moving. Stellar issued assets such as USDC require
the destination recipient to exist on Stellar and hold the asset trustline
before a quote can be treated as production-ready; the backend preflights this
before calling 1Click. When 1Click has no current liquidity for the Stellar
settlement asset, an explicitly flagged quote-evidence destination can be
enabled to prove SDK quote creation and signature verification without claiming
Stellar escrow funding. Live NEAR execution still needs source-wallet execution
and tiny-amount no-testnet evidence. See
[`docs/NEAR_INTENTS_BOUNDARY.md`](docs/NEAR_INTENTS_BOUNDARY.md).

Stripe Connect remains The Signal production marketplace's fiat payment rail
and is not implemented inside this repository. This repo owns the Stellar
escrow rail and marketplace-compatible binding model; adding Stripe here would
mix production marketplace payments with the grant demo service. See
[`docs/PAYMENT_RAIL_BOUNDARY.md`](docs/PAYMENT_RAIL_BOUNDARY.md).

## Key Features

- **Fund-Once Milestone Escrow** — Deals split into milestones (e.g., 30/50/20). The client can lock the remaining deal balance once, then release or dispute each milestone independently.
- **Atomic 3-Way Splits** — Every release executes three transfers in one atomic transaction: Provider, Connector (BD), and Protocol.
- **On-Chain Reputation** — Providers accumulate a verifiable deal completion counter on-chain. Cannot be faked.
- **Dispute Resolution** — Either party raises a dispute to freeze funds. Admin resolution supports provider win, client refund, or partial split outcomes with explicit on-chain states.
- **Wallet Prep** — Prepare testnet funds and swap XLM into the configured USDC-compatible testnet settlement asset before funding a milestone.
- **Cross-Chain Add Funds Entry** — From the first pending milestone, review the wallet's settlement-asset balance, fund the remaining deal balance directly when enough balance is available, or choose a source chain/asset and quote a NEAR Intents/1Click top-up into the connected Stellar wallet before confirming Fund Deal. Deal-tied top-ups show human Stellar units and lock the destination to the deal's approved Stellar settlement asset: USDC-compatible settlement token or XLM.
- **Privy Wallet Path** — Embedded Stellar wallet flow for the Tranche 2 demo, with Stellar Wallets Kit support retained in the codebase.
- **Indexer Dashboard** — Soroban RPC event reader writes decoded escrow events into an isolated MongoDB read model and exposes `/market_dashboard`.
- **Live Network Ticker** — Real-time on-chain contract data displayed on the homepage marquee (read-only, no wallet required).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) with `wasm32v1-none` target
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli)
- Node.js 18+
- A Privy app ID for the embedded wallet path, or a Stellar wallet extension for the fallback wallet-kit path

### 1. Build the Smart Contract

```bash
stellar contract build
stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/deal_escrow.wasm
cargo test
```

### 2. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet --fund

stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/deal_escrow.wasm \
  --source-account deployer \
  --network testnet \
  --alias deal_escrow

stellar contract invoke --id deal_escrow --source-account deployer --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin deployer \
  --protocol_wallet deployer
```

### 3. Run the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID, VITE_DEAL_ESCROW_CONTRACT,
# VITE_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS, VITE_SOROSWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS,
# VITE_SOROSWAP_POOL_ADDRESS, and any VITE_STELLAR_* network overrides

npm run dev
```

### 4. Try It

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` — the landing page shows "Trust Engine." with a live glitch effect
2. Click **Connect Wallet** and use Privy or a Stellar testnet wallet
3. Fund your wallet with 10,000 XLM via Friendbot
4. Use **Wallet Prep** to swap XLM into demo test USDC through the seeded Soroswap testnet route if the deal requires that settlement asset
5. Create a deal using a Quick Start scenario
6. In **Deals**, open the first pending milestone, confirm the deal-funding balance row, then choose **Fund Deal with XLM/tUSDC** when the wallet has enough balance or use **Prepare Wallet** / **Top Up from Another Chain** when it does not
7. For the cross-chain path, request a remaining-balance top-up quote, wait for the connected Stellar wallet balance to be ready, then confirm **Fund Deal**; escrow state remains gated on Stellar `funded` events
8. Release funded milestones and watch the 3-way split visualization
9. Check synced events in `/market_dashboard`
10. For final-tranche marketplace proof, run `npm run seed:marketplace-bindings` from `indexer/` to create shadow Signal-style bindings, then reconcile through the protected binding API
11. Check the provider's on-chain reputation in the Oracle tab

## Smart Contract API

| Function | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin, protocol_wallet)` | Deployer | One-time setup |
| `create_deal(client, provider, connector, token, fee_bps, share_bps, milestones)` | Client | Create escrow deal |
| `fund_deal(deal_id)` | Client | Fund all pending milestones in one payment |
| `deposit(deal_id, milestone_idx)` | Client | Fund one milestone; retained for staged funding/backwards compatibility |
| `release_milestone(deal_id, milestone_idx)` | Client | Atomic 3-way split |
| `dispute(caller, deal_id, milestone_idx)` | Client/Provider | Freeze disputed milestone |
| `resolve_dispute(deal_id, milestone_idx, refund_bps)` | Admin | Split disputed funds |
| `refund(deal_id)` | Admin | Full refund of funded milestones |
| `get_deal(deal_id)` | Anyone | Read deal state |
| `get_reputation(provider)` | Anyone | Read provider's completed deal count |

## Split Math

```text
Example: $10,000 milestone, 10% platform fee, 40% connector share

platform_fee    = $10,000 × 10%  = $1,000
connector_cut   = $1,000  × 40%  = $400
protocol_cut    = $1,000  − $400  = $600
provider_cut    = $10,000 − $1,000 = $9,000

→ Provider:  $9,000 (90%)
→ Connector: $400   (4%)
→ Protocol:  $600   (6%)
```

## Test Suite

13 comprehensive tests:

| # | Test | Verifies |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | Happy path (single milestone) | Create → Fund → Release → verify split |
| 2 | Multi-milestone (30/50/20) | Fund deal once, release milestones independently |
| 3 | Reputation counter | Increments on deal completion |
| 4 | Dispute + resolve | Freeze → admin resolves 50/50 |
| 5 | Full refund | Admin refunds all funded milestones |
| 6 | Dispute provider win | Admin can release disputed funds fully to provider |
| 7 | Dispute client win | Admin can refund disputed funds fully to client |
| 8 | Auth checks | Non-client cannot deposit |
| 9 | Double deposit prevention | Cannot fund same milestone twice |
| 10 | Release unfunded fails | Cannot release a Pending milestone |
| 11 | Deal count tracking | Counter increments correctly |
| 12 | Variable commission (65%) | Architect tier connector share |
| 13 | Milestone count limit | Rejects deals with more than 20 milestones |

```bash
cargo test
# running 13 tests ... test result: ok. 13 passed; 0 failed
```

| Milestone lifecycle | Pending → Funded → Released / Resolved / Refunded | Same states, on-chain |
| BD connector tiers | 40–65% of platform fee | Parameterized per deal |
| Dispute escalation | Admin dashboard + Stripe | Smart contract + admin auth |
| Reputation | Database counter | Persistent storage on-chain |
| Payment | Stripe Connect | SAC token transfers |

## Tranche 2 Demo Positioning

For SCF review, describe the demo as:

```text
The Tranche 2 testnet deployment demonstrates a complete Soroban B2B escrow
lifecycle with Privy wallet connection, testnet deal creation, milestone
funding/release with automatic multi-party payout split, Soroban RPC event
indexing into an isolated backend dashboard, and XLM-to-demo-test-USDC
multi-asset funding through a seeded Soroswap testnet route.
```

Avoid overclaiming the testnet route as production Circle USDC or a live
multi-venue aggregator path. The demo token and seeded pool are intentionally
testnet-only so reviewers can reproduce the flow even when public testnet
liquidity is empty.
