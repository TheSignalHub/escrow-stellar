# Smart Contract Reference

## Overview

The `DealEscrowContract` is a Soroban smart contract that implements milestone-based escrow with atomic 3-way payment splits. It is written in Rust using `soroban-sdk` v22.0.0.

**Contract ID (Testnet release candidate)**: `CD6RMOJUTNMHC6D6ODS4IJPCLZNUSH6BE6IRK2CZI47AVOCFJ7QRIRWJ`

**Source**: [`contracts/deal_escrow/src/lib.rs`](../contracts/deal_escrow/src/lib.rs)

## Feature Log

| Timestamp | Feature / Area | Change Logged | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-21 14:29 BST | Mainnet-candidate contract hardening | Added explicit `Resolved` deal/milestone states for partial dispute settlements, reduced `funded_amount` whenever escrowed funds leave the contract, capped deals at 20 milestones, and expanded dispute outcome tests. | `cargo test` passed with 13 tests; frontend and indexer builds passed. |
| 2026-07-21 15:09 BST | Testnet release-candidate deployment | Deployed and initialized hardened DealEscrow on Stellar Testnet as `CD6RMOJUTNMHC6D6ODS4IJPCLZNUSH6BE6IRK2CZI47AVOCFJ7QRIRWJ`. | CLI smoke passed: create, deposit, release, provider dispute win, client refund, partial settlement, reputation, and deal count. |

## Types

### MilestoneStatus

```rust
enum MilestoneStatus {
    Pending,    // Created, awaiting funding
    Funded,     // Client deposited tokens
    Released,   // Split executed, funds distributed
    Disputed,   // Frozen by client or provider
    Resolved,   // Admin split dispute funds between client and provider
    Refunded,   // Returned to client after dispute resolution
}
```

### DealStatus

```rust
enum DealStatus {
    Created,    // Deal parameters set, no funding yet
    Active,     // At least one milestone funded
    Completed,  // All milestones released
    Cancelled,  // All milestones refunded
    Disputed,   // At least one milestone disputed
    Resolved,   // Terminal deal with at least one partial dispute settlement
}
```

### Milestone

```rust
struct Milestone {
    amount: i128,              // Token amount (7 decimal precision)
    status: MilestoneStatus,
}
```

### Deal

```rust
struct Deal {
    client: Address,           // Who pays (escrow depositor)
    provider: Address,         // Who delivers (receives bulk payment)
    connector: Address,        // Who referred (receives commission)
    protocol_wallet: Address,  // Platform fee recipient
    token: Address,            // SAC token contract address
    total_amount: i128,        // Sum of all milestone amounts
    platform_fee_bps: u32,     // Platform fee in basis points (1000 = 10%)
    connector_share_bps: u32,  // Connector's share of fee (4000 = 40%)
    milestones: Vec<Milestone>,
    status: DealStatus,
    funded_amount: i128,       // Total currently held in escrow
}
```

## Functions

### initialize

```rust
fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, protocol_wallet: Address) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

One-time contract setup. Must be called before any other function.

**Parameters**:
- `admin` — Address authorized for dispute resolution and refunds
- `protocol_wallet` — Address that receives the protocol's share of fees

**Errors**: `AlreadyInitialized` if called more than once.

---

### create_deal

```rust
fn create_deal(
    env: Env,
    client: Address,
    provider: Address,
    connector: Address,
    token_addr: Address,
    platform_fee_bps: u32,
    connector_share_bps: u32,
    milestone_amounts: Vec<i128>,
) -> Result<u64, EscrowError>
```

Creates a new deal with defined participants and milestones.

**Authorization**: `client.require_auth()`

**Parameters**:
- `client` — The party depositing funds
- `provider` — The party delivering services
- `connector` — The BD referrer who connected the parties
- `token_addr` — SAC token address (XLM, USDC, etc.)
- `platform_fee_bps` — Total platform fee as basis points (1000 = 10%)
- `connector_share_bps` — Connector's share of the platform fee (4000 = 40%)
- `milestone_amounts` — Vector of amounts for each milestone

**Returns**: `deal_id` (auto-incrementing `u64`)

**Validation**:
- `platform_fee_bps` and `connector_share_bps` must be ≤ 10000
- `milestone_amounts` cannot be empty
- `milestone_amounts` cannot exceed 20 entries
- Each amount must be > 0

**Events**: `("created", deal_id) → total_amount`

---

### deposit

```rust
fn deposit(env: Env, deal_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

Funds a specific milestone by transferring tokens from client to contract.

**Authorization**: `deal.client.require_auth()`

**Flow**:
1. Validates milestone is in `Pending` status
2. Executes SAC `transfer(client → contract, amount)`
3. Updates milestone to `Funded`
4. Increases `funded_amount`
5. If first deposit, updates deal to `Active`

**Events**: `("funded", deal_id, milestone_idx) → amount`

---

### release_milestone

```rust
fn release_milestone(env: Env, deal_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

Releases a funded milestone with atomic 3-way split.

**Authorization**: `deal.client.require_auth()`

**Split Calculation**:
```
platform_fee  = amount × platform_fee_bps / 10000
connector_cut = platform_fee × connector_share_bps / 10000
protocol_cut  = platform_fee - connector_cut
provider_cut  = amount - platform_fee
```

**Flow**:
1. Validates deal is `Active` and milestone is `Funded`
2. Computes three payment amounts
3. Executes three atomic transfers: provider, connector, protocol
4. Updates milestone to `Released`
5. Decreases `funded_amount`
6. If all milestones released: sets deal to `Completed` and increments provider reputation

**Events**:
- `("released", deal_id, milestone_idx) → (provider_cut, connector_cut, protocol_cut)`
- `("done", deal_id) → reputation_count` (only when all milestones complete)

---

### dispute

```rust
fn dispute(env: Env, caller: Address, deal_id: u64, milestone_idx: u32) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

Freezes a funded milestone. Can be called by either client or provider.

**Authorization**: `caller.require_auth()` — must be deal's client or provider.

**Flow**:
1. Validates milestone is `Funded`
2. Updates milestone to `Disputed`
3. Updates deal to `Disputed`

**Events**: `("dispute", deal_id, milestone_idx) → caller`

---

### resolve_dispute

```rust
fn resolve_dispute(
    env: Env,
    deal_id: u64,
    milestone_idx: u32,
    refund_bps: u32,
) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

Admin resolves a dispute by splitting funds between client and provider.

**Authorization**: `admin.require_auth()`

**Parameters**:
- `refund_bps` — Percentage to refund client (0 = all to provider, 5000 = 50/50, 10000 = full refund)

**Flow**:
1. Computes `client_refund = amount × refund_bps / 10000`
2. Computes `provider_amount = amount - client_refund`
3. Transfers both amounts
4. Decreases `funded_amount`
5. Updates milestone outcome:
   - `refund_bps = 0`: `Released` (provider win)
   - `refund_bps = 10000`: `Refunded` (client refund)
   - otherwise: `Resolved` (partial settlement)
6. Recomputes deal status:
   - all released: `Completed`
   - all refunded: `Cancelled`
   - any partial settlement with no remaining pending/funded/disputed milestone: `Resolved`
   - otherwise active/disputed/created based on remaining milestones

**Events**: `("resolved", deal_id, milestone_idx) → (client_refund, provider_amount)`

---

### refund

```rust
fn refund(env: Env, deal_id: u64) -> Result<(), EscrowError>
```

Full refund of all funded or disputed milestones. Admin only.

**Authorization**: `admin.require_auth()`

**Flow**:
1. Iterates all milestones
2. Refunds every `Funded` or `Disputed` milestone to client
3. Decreases `funded_amount` by the refunded amount
4. Sets deal to `Cancelled`

**Events**: `("refund", deal_id) → total_refunded`

---

### get_deal

```rust
fn get_deal(env: Env, deal_id: u64) -> Result<Deal, EscrowError>
```

Read-only. Returns the full deal struct.

---

### get_deal_count

```rust
fn get_deal_count(env: Env) -> Result<u64, EscrowError>
```

Read-only. Returns the total number of deals created.

---

### get_reputation

```rust
fn get_reputation(env: Env, provider: Address) -> u64
```

Read-only. Returns the number of completed deals for a provider address. Returns 0 if no deals completed.

## Test Coverage

The contract includes 13 unit tests covering:

1. **Happy path** — Single milestone: create, fund, release, verify exact split amounts ($9,000 / $400 / $600 on a $10,000 deal)
2. **Multi-milestone** — Three milestones (30/50/20) totaling $100,000
3. **Reputation** — Counter increments correctly across multiple deals
4. **Dispute resolution** — Freeze + admin 50/50 split
5. **Full refund** — Admin returns all escrowed funds
6. **Authorization** — Non-client deposit panics with auth error
7. **Double deposit** — Same milestone cannot be funded twice
8. **Release unfunded** — Cannot release a Pending milestone
9. **Deal counter** — Increments correctly across multiple deals
10. **Variable rates** — Architect tier (65%) connector share
11. **Provider dispute win** — `refund_bps = 0` marks the milestone `Released`, completes the deal, and increments reputation
12. **Client dispute win** — `refund_bps = 10000` marks the milestone `Refunded` and cancels the deal
13. **Milestone cap** — More than 20 milestones fails with `TooManyMilestones`
